# Product Brief: TourVN App

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Author:** Nguye

---

## Executive Summary

**TourVN** is a mobile application designed to revolutionize how **Vietnamese tourists** discover and explore their own country. By combining AI-powered content curation from social media (particularly TikTok video transcripts) with verified tour guide services, TourVN addresses the critical gap between scattered, unreliable travel information and the authentic, up-to-date guidance tourists need.

The app serves three user types: **Tourists** seeking reliable destination recommendations, **Tour Guides** building their business through verified profiles, and **Admins** ensuring content quality. With a Vietnamese-first approach focusing on hidden gems, **mood-based discovery**, and daily-refreshed AI content, TourVN transforms the overwhelming task of trip planning into a simple, emotionally-driven discovery experience.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Vietnamese tourists struggle to find **suitable destinations and trustworthy tours** when planning trips within Vietnam. Current information sources provide outdated, overly commercialized recommendations that lead to **disappointment and wasted travel experiences**.

### Problem Impact

- **Wasted time** searching across multiple non-specialized platforms
- **Disappointment** when destinations don't match expectations from inaccurate reviews
- **Missed opportunities** to discover authentic local experiences and hidden gems
- **Difficulty connecting** with legitimate, verified tour guides
- **Information overload** without clear, actionable recommendations

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Platform | Gap |
|----------|-----|
| **TikTok** | Entertainment-focused, not organized for trip planning; content disappears in feeds |
| **Google Maps** | Generic reviews, not tourism-specialized; lacks local Vietnamese perspective |
| **Instagram** | Curated/filtered content; hard to find practical travel information |
| **Traditional sites** | Outdated information; overly commercial "tourist trap" recommendations |

**Core Issue:** None of these platforms are **specialized for Vietnam tourism** with fresh, authentic, organized content.

### Proposed Solution

TourVN provides a **tourism-specialized platform** where users simply open the app and find the perfect destination. Key capabilities:

1. **AI-Curated Content** - Fresh articles generated daily from TikTok videos, ensuring up-to-date authentic content
2. **Mood-Based Discovery** - Find destinations by emotion: 'Beach vibes' 🏖️, 'Mountain escape' ⛰️, 'Food adventure' 🍜
3. **Location-Based Filtering** - Distance and trending status as secondary filters
4. **Verified Reviews** - Real visitor feedback organized by location
5. **Tour Guide Marketplace** - KYC-verified guides offering group tours
6. **Seasonal Intelligence** - Alerts for time-sensitive experiences

### Key Differentiators

1. 🎬 **TikTok-to-Article AI Pipeline** - Daily refresh of viral travel content into organized, searchable articles
2. 🇻🇳 **Vietnamese-First Focus** - Local hidden gems, Vietnamese language and culture priority
3. 💭 **Mood-Based Discovery** - Emotions drive travel, not just categories
4. ✅ **Verified Tour Guides** - KYC-approved guides with transparent offerings
5. 🎯 **Simplicity** - Open app → Feel the vibe → Find destination

### Target Market Strategy

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Vietnamese domestic tourists
- **Phase 2:** International visitors seeking authentic Vietnam experiences
